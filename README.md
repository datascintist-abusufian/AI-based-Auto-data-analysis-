## Get Started

### Option 1: Install via Python PIP

```bash
# Install data_formulator
pip install data_formulator

# Start Data Formulator
data_formulator

# Alternatively, run with a specific port
python -m data_formulator --port 8080


Data Formulator will open in your browser at http://localhost:5000.

Option 2: Codespaces (5 minutes)
Run Data Formulator in GitHub Codespaces with everything pre-configured.
Open in GitHub Codespaces

Option 3: Developer Mode
For full control and customization, follow the DEVELOPMENT.md guide.

Using Data Formulator
Set Up: Provide your OpenAI API key, select a model (e.g., GPT-4o), and choose a dataset.

Create Visualizations:

Choose a chart type and drag-and-drop data fields to specify visual encodings.

Type names of fields that don't exist in the current dataset to trigger AI-powered transformations.

Click Formulate to generate the visualization.

Iterate: Use natural language prompts to refine or create new visualizations.

Developers' Guide
Follow the DEVELOPMENT.md instructions to build custom tools on top of Data Formulator.
