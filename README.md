Using Data Formulator
Set Up: Provide your OpenAI API key, select a model (e.g., GPT-4o), and choose a dataset.

Create Visualizations:

Choose a chart type and drag-and-drop data fields to specify visual encodings.

Type names of fields that don't exist in the current dataset to trigger AI-powered transformations.

Click Formulate to generate the visualization.

Iterate: Use natural language prompts to refine or create new visualizations.
